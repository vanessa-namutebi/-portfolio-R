                        <p>I hold a Bachelor of Commerce (Accounting) degree and bring two years of hands-on experience in both traditional and remote accounting. My expertise includes QuickBooks (online and desktop), Tally, Xero, and advanced use of MS Excel and Word. I'm also trained in handling Uganda’s taxes (PAYE, VAT through EFRIS, and income tax), and I bring strong analytical and problem-solving skills to every project I take on.</p>
                            <p>But there’s more to me than just numbers. Outside the office, I’m an avid football fan and enjoy singing whenever I get the chance. I believe in balancing life and work with the same energy, staying friendly and approachable with both colleagues and clients alike. Whether collaborating with diverse teams or helping businesses grow through strategic insights, I’m all about making meaningful connections and striving for excellence.</p>
                               <p> I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my skills, contribute to forward-thinking organizations, and make a meaningful impact in the world of finance.</p>
